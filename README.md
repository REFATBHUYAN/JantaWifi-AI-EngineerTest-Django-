# Project README

## Overview

This repository contains a project focused on developing a web application for visualizing stock data using Django. The application allows users to select a trade code from a dropdown menu and displays a line chart representing the closing prices of stocks associated with the selected trade code.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in several areas:

- **Django Web Development**: I deepened my understanding of building web applications using the Django framework, including creating views, templates, and handling HTTP requests.
- **Data Preparation**: I learn to preparing csv data and send it to database.
- **Data Filtering and Ordering**: I became proficient in filtering and ordering database query results in Django using the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).


## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges:

- **Data Visualization Integration**: Integrating data visualization within the Django framework required careful coordination between front-end and back-end components.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Handling dynamic data preparation and scaling.
- **Debugging**: Debugging issues related to data retrieval, rendering, and JavaScript event handling required thorough testing and troubleshooting.

Overall, overcoming these challenges enriched my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of web development concepts.
